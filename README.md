## Usage
The use of endpoints is very simple, previously you could see a table of endpoints that you can call, if you need to create a product or update a product, here we have some examples.

### Example: **product creation**:

Request Body:
```json
{
  "name": "Guitar",
  "color": "Brown",
  "category": "Music",
  "price": "200"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
    "message": "Product added successfully",
    "data": {
        "name": "Guitar",
        "color": "Brown",
        "category": "Music",
        "price": "200",
        "id": 1
    }
}
```
### Example: **product update**:

Request Body:
```json
{
    "name":"Guitar",
    "color":"Black",
    "category":"Music",
    "price":"250"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
    "message": "Product updated successfully",
    "data": {
        "name": "Guitar",
        "color": "Black",
        "category": "Music",
        "price": "250",
        "id": "1"
    }
